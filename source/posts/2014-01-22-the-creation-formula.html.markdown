What are the necessary things one need to collect before achieving creativity? We agree creativity is some kind of innate talent some have more than others. We also agree we can become more creative with the right thinking skills. Agree we have not a simple root framework as a backbone of the creative process.

I've been thinking about how we create. If there was a formula for the creative process, what would its parameters be? What should we seek and combine in order to create creativity? Here's a simple equation I've come up with. 

> x = Craft × Consideration × Consciousness

Whether it's inventing a useful new contraption, developing a clever advertising campaign, writing a bestselling novel or making a blockbuster film, this is the pattern most if not every creative endeavor have in common.

Let's assume X as the factor that makes something great. The more X in something have the greater it is. X isn't necessarily mass, in case I've push you into a less-is-more defense. It's the abstract construct on the side of of an equation which other side deals with the more identifiable qualities.
