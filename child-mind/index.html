It’s at the end of the arti­cle.)</p> <p>Have you seen the Bollywood film <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Idiots"><em>3 Idiots</em></a>? It’s the highest-grossing Bol­ly­wood film of all time in India about the adven­tures of three col­lege engi­neer­ing stu­dents. One of the scenes left an impression on me.</p> <p><img alt="space pen" src="//farm8.staticflickr.com/7305/12143613986_30f18aeeee_o.jpg"/> <img alt="space pen" src="//farm6.staticflickr.com/5527/12142958075_fc1907eebc_o.jpg"/> <img alt=pencil src="//farm8.staticflickr.com/7378/12143203883_3699707dbc_o.jpg"/></p> <p><em>*Let me clar­ify that I am aware this space pen story is an urban myth. I am only using it as a sto­ry­telling device and for some humor (at least for me and the audi­ence in the the­atre who laughed at the scene). It made me think about how we over­think which led to this post. Whether it is true or not is besides the point.</em></p> <hr/> <p>As the chil­dren we once were, grow­ing up was a process of becom­ing adults. Not only bio­log­i­cally but also men­tally. We learned to be respon­si­ble, to pay the bills, to get things done and we learned the com­plex world of adult­hood. To become adults we had to lose our tantrums, silli­ness, our child­hood. And we lost our minds. Our child-like minds.</p> <p>The mind of a child is the great­est gift we will ever receive. As embryos in our moth­ers’ womb, our heart, the first organ to develop only to power the next organ—the devel­op­ing brain which is soon mak­ing a quar­ter of a mil­lion new neu­rons every minute. In the first 10 years of life, our infant brain will have made bil­lions and bil­lions of con­nec­tions. It is a super­charged engine for learn­ing and cre­ativ­ity. Yet by adult­hood we have <a href="//www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html">lost most of this creativity</a>. We now think like adults. That is we think too much and our thoughts are too influ­enced by our knowl­edge. We need to get back our abil­ity to think like kids again. How?</p> <p>Where online would you find a lot of smart and knowl­edge­able peo­ple? Quora of course. I really like to visit Quora and learn from sub­ject mat­ter experts show­ing off their wits and exper­tise. Though some­times they over­think and com­pli­cate prob­lems with com­pli­cated answers. Many times peo­ple are just try­ing to show off how clever they are with rocket sci­ence. Like <a href="//www.quora.com/What-is-the-easiest-way-to-cut-a-pizza-into-11-equal-slices">this question</a> on Quora.</p> <p><img alt="Quora question" src="//farm4.staticflickr.com/3732/12143449744_d1886c2cfd_o.png"/></p> <p>The most pop­u­lar answer for the ques­tion before I answered involved cal­cu­la­tions with com­passes, con­cen­tric cir­cles, Pythagorean the­o­rem and square roots. I have no idea what a con­cen­tric cir­cle is, let alone cooks in a pizza kitchen. And who keeps com­passes in a kitchen? But since it’s the most pop­u­lar answer I sup­pose over­think­ing is pop­u­lar in Quora.</p> <p>I imag­ined myself with no math­e­mat­i­cal knowl­edge, a cook good with my hands, in a hot and humid kitchen faced with this prob­lem. What would I do? Turns out that the bet­ter solu­tion is much sim­pler and would only required a piece of string and a pen at the very least. Shouldn’t be too hard to find in a kitchen. And so I offered <a href="//www.quora.com/What-is-the-easiest-way-to-cut-a-pizza-into-11-equal-slices/answer/Aen-Tan">my answer</a>.</p> <p>All you have to do is cir­cle a string around the pizza to cut a length equal to the pizza cir­cum­fer­ence. Then fash­ion a divider of some sort or even use your thumb and index fin­ger. Adjust your thumb and fin­ger and wrap the string eleven times equally around them. This effec­tively divides the string into eleven equal parts. Use a pen and mark the string. Cir­cle the string around the pizza again and cut using the mark­ings as guides. My answer received more than a hun­dred votes, went on to become the most voted and the ques­tion was made a <em>Best Source</em>.</p> <p><img alt=Solution src="//farm3.staticflickr.com/2890/12143753226_66a141e5eb_z.jpg"/></p> <p>Con­jur­ing com­plex math­e­mat­i­cal equa­tions may make you look smart but to become truly cre­ative you need to be able to lib­er­ate your mind from the the burden of knowl­edge, edu­ca­tion and banality you have accu­mu­lated. Only then can you think like a child again.</p> <h3 id=answer-to-the-numbers-question>Answer to the numbers question</h3> <p>The ques­tion has noth­ing to do with math­e­mat­ics. Look for the closed loops or shapes in each num­ber and count them. In 0, 6, 8 and 9. 8 has two of them. 2581 has two. The answer is 2.</p> <hr/> <p><em>First published in my old website and reposted on <a href="//lifehacker.com/5899592/overthinking-and-your-child+like-mind">Lifehacker</a>.</em></p> </div> </article> <div id=comments class=container> <div id=disqus_thread></div> <script>
